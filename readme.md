Welcome, this is the .NET interns assigment repository.

You will find the assignments in the docs folder, your task is to resolve them. 

You can use the unit tests to verify if your implementation is correct, check the /tests/AutomatedTests project for more details. Do not modify the implementation there. 

You will have to implement your solution into the src/GeneralProgramming project. You will find separate files for each assignment. 

You can use the /src/dev project for experiments and development with console output

Tasks:
- [Task 1](docs/Task_1.md)
- [Task 2](docs/Task_2.md)
- [Task 3](docs/Task_3.md)
- [Task 4](docs/Task_4.md)


Good luck.
